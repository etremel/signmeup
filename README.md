# signmeup
Real-time application to sign up for and manage TA hours. Built with Meteor.

## About

SignMeUp is a web application that allows teaching assistants to hold hours and labs, and students to sign up for them. In essence, it is an online queue.

SMU is built with Meteor, and uses MongoDB as a data store and Semantic UI for CSS.

This repository is a fork of [the main SignMeUp repository](https://github.com/signmeup/signmeup) for the purpose of changing its configuration and settings to work smoothly at Cornell.
